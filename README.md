This repository contains all the 54-card expansions, either completed or in progress, that we have worked on at HPP.

Completed expansions:
 * Extra Credit - Extra ships and goals to be used with the core game
 * No Holds Barred - Cards designed by our Indiegogo backers
 * Ponyville University - An expansion focused on all the foals and fillies, but at college age

WIP expansions:
 * It's Practically Canon - An expansion devoted to fanon favorite pairs
 * Panels of Ponies - An expansion inspired by the official comics
 * Power Gaming - An expansion with new mechanics designed for the more sadistic players out there
 
 
Note from Shipmaster 001: These expansions belong to Horrible People Productions. I only borrowed the files so that I could complete the WIP expansions.
